IDA ICE API upadtes from EQUA:

I have implemented a way to import IFC-files through the API (Well, you need to test how it works).
 
There is a zip file at  http://www.equaonline.com/temp/ifcapi.zip
 
It contains a new dll, a new manual and a patch-file. (the .dll is 64-bit. Do you need a 32-bit, let me know, and I will send it (if you want to put the .dll in the installation folder, it needs to be 32 bit).
 
Put the patch file (the .fsl-file) in [installation folder]\lib\ice\ice.patches\
 
 
Now you should be able to use:
 
long openIFCFile(char *path, long mergeWindows, long keepIntersectingSpaces, long ingoreRoof, char *out, int out_len)
Imports the .ifc file specified by path. The three parameters mergeWindows keepIntersectingSpaces and ignoreRoof can be set to 0 (do not use) or 1 (use). The parameters are from the IFC import options in IDA ICE.
 
Returns the imported building object.
 
 
Check what you want to set the parameters to in the IDA ICE GUI version of the IFC import.
